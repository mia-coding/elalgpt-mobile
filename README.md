Hello! My name is Mia and this is a mobile version of the chatbot that I made my chapter of my global Youth Organization called BBYO!
This chatbot utilizes NLP (Natural Language Processing) for individuals to train the AI chatbot on their own for only the information they want.
This chatbot was important to me so that people in my chapter could recieve immediate and accurate information that might not be readily available online about our chapter and events!
Through this project I learned what NLP was and how to utilize it for my chatbot, I improved on my GUI skills in HTML and CSS, I enhanced my programming in Python and Java, 
This was the first time I've ever encountered Swift and working with writing apps, which taugt me a lot as well!
I fully learned what a Front End and Back End are and how to connect them for my program, I got to explore and better my designing skills to fully plan my own big project for the first time, and so much more! 
I had so much fun making this project and I hope you enjoy it as well!
This code is made to be run on Xcode, and might be published on the app store shortly!
